On Thursday, October 2, Cooper Union welcomed Professor Daniel Barber, Associate Chair of the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, to deliver a free, public lecture on how structural design responds to the environment and to global climate change.

The Rose Auditorium hosted Prof. Barber as he took his audience through the historical progression of an architectural movement he calls “environmentalization”, which he described as a specific undercurrent of the larger modernism movement of the 20th century.

As an architecture historian, Prof. Barber studies how other architects consider scientific and historical knowledge of the global environment and incorporate them in their own work. In his talk he cited the work of Victor and Aladar Olgyay, pioneers in the field of bio-architecture in the mid-century, as an example of using purposeful structural design as a means to maintain the climate in a space. He emphasized the benefits of this approach, as opposed to mechanical systems, for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) implemented in almost every modern high-rise. The Olgyays researched a precise definition of the universal comfort zone, which involves the optimal balance of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight. To maintain this balance, the Olgyays designed the brise-soleil, a sunshade that deflects sunlight, which is now a commonly used structural feature in landmark buildings, such as the UNESCO headquarters in Paris and The New York Times building.

In the informal Q&A session following his lecture, Prof. Barber also commented on the need for more open and frequent public discourse on this matter. He voiced his opinion about changing the conversation to refrain from discussing how previous decisions in history have resulted in the current climate crisis, and instead move towards openly discussing what needs to be done now. He said “we’re sick of hearing about how we should have done it differently”. They say hindsight is 20/20 and there is no doubt that learning from mistakes made in the past can prevent foolish repetition of the same mistakes. However, the need for clairvoyance is now and decisions for our future must be made in the present. Responding candidly, Prof. Barber echoed this sentiment by saying that “[we could all spend time] marching up and down 6th Avenue” (in reference to the People’s Climate March on September 21), but the political interpretations may not align necessarily with what needs to be done for the climate.”
