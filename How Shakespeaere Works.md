Prof. Germano, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, has embarked on a new project: delivering a series of free lectures on the works of Shakespeare. “These talks are designed as an introduction – or reintroduction – to Shakespeare the poet-playwright-player and to the world of his plays.” Over the course of nine one-hour lectures, Dean Germano will deconstruct the themes, characters and context of Shakespeare’s less known works.

In an interview with The Pioneer, Dean Germano emphasized the relevance of Shakespearean literature to students of The Cooper Union, noting that “they [students] were first introduced to Shakespeare in early high school. Now that they are older, they can begin to appreciate the full extent to which Shakespeare addresses themes for more mature audiences”. Outside his most famous plays, like Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, he explores mature themes like power, revenge, gender and sex. It is for this reason that Dean Germano selected plays like Titus Andronicus and The Winter’s Tale for further analysis in his lecture series.

Delivered in The Great Hall every Monday evening at 6 o’clock, Dean Germano’s lectures don’t require a long time commitment and are both enlightening and entertaining.  In fact, a portion of his first lecture was entirely in iambic pentameter! For more information: [click here](http://bit.ly/HowShakespeareWorks).
