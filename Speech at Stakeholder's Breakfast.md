**Selamat Pagi**, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

This morning I’m going to do things a little bit differently. By getting to know people from all over the globe, I have developed an intense curiosity for all the languages of the world. So, I’m going to use selected, special words from the languages I have come across during my short time here at JIS to describe what makes this school so extraordinary. Now, what makes these words distinctive is that they convey meanings that simply cannot be fully translated to English- so bear with me as I try my best to explain how each one contributes to my understanding of what makes JIS, JIS. 

The people who make up JIS continue to reach ever higher- in their goals, in their aspirations, and in their achievements. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of our community is how we manage to do this in a way that the Arabs call **taarradhin**. This first special word – *taarradhin* – is somewhat similar in meaning to the word ‘compromise’, but without the negative connotation. *Taarradhin* indicates a situation where all the people involved gain a definitive benefit. The way this relates to the JIS community is that, while we all aspire for great things from ourselves, we never step on each other’s toes to get what we want. This is why students can experiment with hydroponic gardens in unused space on the roof, ….without tearing down the track and gym that allow our athletes to run faster, jump higher and be stronger. At JIS we have a deep, fraternal respect for one another and we take pride in that. 

Built on this innate culture of respect, grow intimate relationships between everyone at this school. The Danes, this time, refer to this as **hygge** – a unique word that can only be described as being cozy, comfortable and absolutely at ease with each other. At JIS, I believe the atmosphere of *hygge* flourishes not only because we spend some of the best times of our lives together, but also because JIS nurtures to be ourselves 100% of the time. This state of mind, where students feel that nothing could ever harm them, is what the Germans call **geborgenheit** – a haven. In my opinion, JIS is a sanctuary for students. This *geborgenheit* becomes the reason that the Forensics team can debate contentious controversies and theater students can perform stories that express deeper truths about our shared humanity. In this way, JIS welcomes individuality just as much as it encourages community bonding, all in an effort to inspire students to be the best versions of themselves.
The school mission is - “We are passionate, inquisitive and creative - learning to be best for the world”. This aligns with the value of **xinku**, a Chinese word that means working hard in the face of tough challenges. As a vibrant place of learning, JIS sets the standard for excellence in an environment that emboldens me to take risks every day since I arrived here last year. When graduation comes around, we owe it to the JIS community to become conduits for being Best for the World. 

As one teacher put it, “JIS is better experienced than summarized.”

As a student here, I know that one can have the JIS experience during every facet of life at school: at IASAS events and theater productions, service involvements and classroom discussions, during spirit week and on UN day, we take part in moments that we will always remember fondly. 

Earlier we listened to the words of some JIS alumni… I would also like to use the words of an alumnus: As a student from the class of 1992 said:
“The greatest moment I experienced at JIS is called Every Day. Every day there are new challenges to be met. Every day there are achievements to attain. Every day there are cultures to be experienced. Every day begins early and ends late and is filled to the brim with learning and laughter and love for life.”

**Terima Kasih**
