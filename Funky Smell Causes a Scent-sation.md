Over the last few weeks, several students have raised a stink about the mysterious foul odor that was emanating from the 5th floor of the NAB. The Pioneer sniffed around to investigate the source of the stench.

One theory suggests that the lockers in the vicinity might have something to do with the smell. Maybe someone left some food over a weekend (or two), letting it putrefy and making the hallways smell rancid. If this is the case, perhaps its time to remind students that the locker area is a shared space – a few bad eggs shouldn’t ruin it for everyone! Personally, I smell this tirade of puns getting stronger. Who nose when it will end!?1?

Others have the impression that some abhorrent business in the nearby bathrooms could have soiled the freshness of air on the entire floor. In the case that this theory is true, the pungent person responsible for this fetid feat certainly should not hold his or her nose up high in pride. Any way you cut it, it’s clear that everyone shouldn’t have to suffer the tainted air quality! 

Mercifully, this smelly situation has now been resolved thanks to the office of buildings and grounds. So one can hope that the only unsavory thing still wafting around The Cooper Union is my scents of humor.
